# Dictionary-using-Trie-Datastructure
3rd sem Data Structures project to implement a real world dictionary using Trie data structure.

All the words of the dictionary are stored in a .txt file. Each line of the file consists of the word followed by a space and the meaning. The meaning can also contain spaces. Each time the code is run,the dictionary is loaded onto a trie data structure. On selecting the exit option, all the nodes are deleted and memory is deallocated.

1)ADD :- with this function we add a new word to the
dictionary along with the meaning.Incase the word
already exists, the new meaning added will be replaced
instead of the old one.

2)SEARCH:- we can search the particular word of our
wish with this function, it will return appropriately based on
the existence of the word in the dictionary.
